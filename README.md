# Stats Calculator
<br>
This is for my math class, where we were doing some statistics. Being too lazy to plug every expression in for every single piece of data, instead I made a rudimentary stats calculator. As we progress, more functions will be added.

### Current functionality:
- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- Range
- Variance
- Standard Deviation
- Mean Deviation
- 5 Number Summary (for box and whisker plots)
